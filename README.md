## A credibility staking platform on Mande Network

### In the credibility staking system, participants receive coins which they can stake on each other to form a voting network. This network is used to calculate the "credibility scores" of each participant.

The strength of each stake is determined quadratically, meaning the voting power is the square root of the number of coins staked. For example, if a friend stakes 25 $MAND tokens on you, your credibility score increases by the square root of 25, which equals 5 points. This method is known as Quadratic Voting.

Quadratic voting emphasizes broad support over the number of tokens staked. 
```bash
For instance, if one friend stakes 100 $MAND tokens on you, 
you receive 10 credibility points (√100 = 10). 
However, if four different friends each stake 25 $MAND tokens, 
your score would increase by 20 points (4*√25 = 20), 
demonstrating the benefit of having multiple supporters.
```

To enhance your credibility score and earn more rewards, encourage your friends to stake their $MAND tokens on your address. The greater the stake, the higher your credibility score. Use the interface below to stake on your friends and help them boost their scores as well!
